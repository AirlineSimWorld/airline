	<h4>Thank you for your kind support of airline-club.com</h4>
	<br/>
	<h4>Since the v2 of the game has transitioned into early Beta stage, we will like to invite all players to consider migrating to v2!</h4>
	<br/>
	<h4>The v1 (this world) will likely be archived and switched off once v2 releases (tentatively in May)</h4>
	<br/>
	<h4>V2 is available at </h4>
	<a href="https://v2.airline-club.com"><h1>https://v2.airline-club.com</h1></a>
	<h4>You will need to register again there.</h4>
	<br/>
	<h4>There are 2 planned resets for v2 before its actual release in May. So feel free to play in this current world if you would like to do so.</h4>
	<h4>However, we would love to see all you awesome people in v2 soon!</h4>
